# Jasmine Testing on an RSS Blog Feed


## Why this Project?

This was built via a test driven development using Jasmine. Testing each idea as you build allows you to be confident that your new additions won't break old ones.


## How to Use

To run the project, simply download the zip, extract and run the index.html file. You will see a list of udacity blog posts. To see other feeds, click the menu and select a new feed.
